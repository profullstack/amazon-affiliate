# Amazon Affiliate Video Automation - Slideshow Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed FFmpeg Slideshow Implementation
- **Problem**: The original implementation only used the first image, creating a static 28-second video
- **Solution**: Implemented proper slideshow functionality that cycles through all product images
- **Key Fix**: Corrected FFmpeg filter complex syntax by separating width/height values instead of using "1280x720" string

### 2. Enhanced Product Review Script Generation
- **Added**: `generateProductReviewScript()` function in `voiceover-generator.js`
- **Features**: 
  - Creates engaging, natural-sounding product review scripts
  - Uses product data (title, price, rating, features, description)
  - Includes randomized intros and conclusions for variety
  - Mentions image slideshow content contextually

### 3. Improved Video Creation Process
- **Fixed**: FFmpeg filter syntax errors that caused slideshow creation to fail
- **Enhanced**: Better error handling and progress reporting
- **Added**: Proper duration calculation per image based on audio length
- **Result**: Creates professional slideshow videos that cycle through all product images
